## Live Web Preview
### Auto refresh your web pages as you develop.

This is a little tool I made for my own needs. It's a simple app that assists web development by displaying an automatically refreshing web view of a selected web page.

### Features

* Automatic reload when the HTML file **or** any of its resources (CSS, JS, images, etc.) are changed. The resources will be detected automatically.
* Setup in just a few clicks. Click Browse and select an HTML file.
* Seamless updating: no white refreshing screen or loading views. 
* Saves & restores the web page and scroll position between launches.

### Download

If you prefer to not compile the source, download a compiled build [here](http://raw.github.com/indragiek/LiveWebPreview/master/LiveWebPreview.zip). Note that this build may not be up to date with current changes.

### Todo List

* Prevent scrollers from flashing when the view is updated
* Add tabs for viewing multiple pages
